Select your post author in style. Select post authors by avatar instead of a select box.

== Description ==

This plugin replaces the regular post author meta box on the edit post screen with a custom box.  The plugin's author box will allow you to select your post author by clicking on the user's avatar.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why was this plugin created? =

Some people are better at seeing things visually rather than reading through text.  This allows you to choose a post author by recognizing their avatar rather than from a drop-down select.

= How do I use it? =

You pretty much use it the same way you always select a post author.  The only difference is that you click their avatar instead of selecting them by user display name.

= Where can I get support? =

The official support forum for this plugin is located at <a href="http://themehybrid.com/board/topics">Theme Hybrid</a>.  I don't generally have time to answer questions on the WordPress.org forums.  Theme Hybrid is my fulltime day job.
